What is a downcut router bit?
Downcut spiral tools are best used for thinner materials which will be pushed down into the machine bed rather than being lifted with an upcut spiral. This can be particularly useful when using vacuum hold down where maintaining the seal between the material and sacrificial bed is crucial. These tools are predominantly used when a high quality cut finish is required on the top surface of cut parts.

Downward spiral tools often require reduced cutting speeds because the chips are pushed back into the material. The chip extraction is generally less effective with this type of tool than it is with an upcut spiral tool.
